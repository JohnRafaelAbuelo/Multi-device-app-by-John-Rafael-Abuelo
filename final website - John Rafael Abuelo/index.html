In 2014, he decided to leave the Ravagers and operate individually, unintentionally becoming a key player in the quest for a precious artifact known as the Orb after stealing it from Morag. Following his arrest, he forged an uneasy alliance with fellow inmates Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot, who together formed the Guardians of the Galaxy. They first rallied as a team by stopping Ronan the Accuser from destroying Xandar with the Power Stone. </p>

During the ensuing conflict, Rocket managed to assist his friends in destroying Ronan, although this resulted in Groot being killed.

Later, Nebula was captured by the Sovereign and handed back to the Guardians, although she was able to escape and help Taserface in a mutiny against Yondu Udonta.

                <p class="feats__description">Ronan was a radical Kree warlord and a former Accuser of the Kree Empire. A participant in the Kree-Skrull War, Ronan worked with Yon-Rogg and the Starforce after the Ambush in Torfa to wipe out the last of the Skrull refugees. Ronan and the Accusers were then called to drop warheads on Earth to wipe out the remaining Skrull opposition there, but were repelled when Captain Marvel came to Earth's defense. The Accusers retreated, with Ronan promising retribution.

                    Further disgusted by an armistice made between the Kree and Nova Empires to end the Kree-Nova War, Ronan initiated a new campaign to eradicate the Xandarians by forging an alliance with Thanos, offering the Orb in exchange for the destruction of Xandar. After a long search, Ronan acquired the Orb, but after realizing it had housed the Power Stone, he instead betrayed Thanos and chose to take the Orb's power for himself. Using his new-found power, he and his forces attacked Xandar, only to be defeated and killed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>

                  <p class="feats__description">Ego's Expansion was an intergalactical conflict orchestrated by the Celestial Ego, a living planet with a humanoid extension of himself, in his quest to conquer and assimilate the universe into new extensions of his consciousness. Over the course of several millennia, Ego planted extraterrestrial seedlings on different planets throughout the cosmos and conceived several children in the hopes that one would be born with Celestial DNA.

                    A child from Earth, Peter Quill genetically inherited the Celestial genes and turned out as Ego's primary target. Quill was convinced to accept his father's agreement and forced to start the process of terraformation in the cosmos. This prompt forced the Guardians of the Galaxy to destroy Ego before he managed to succeed the intergalactic terraformation planning to kill all life and billions of all targeted planets' populations.</p>

                  <p class="feats__description">Thanos was a genocidal warlord from Titan, whose main objective was to bring stability to the universe, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire supply of resources and perish. To complete this goal, Thanos set about hunting down all the Infinity Stones, which combined could wipe out half the universe, being aided by the Black Order, composed of his adopted children. However, the arrival of time-traveling Avengers from 2023 alerted him about the events of the Infinity War and how it would end. By capturing Nebula, he used reverse-engineered technology to venture to the future and lay siege on the Avengers, as he decided to wipe out the entire universe and replace it. However, Thanos had been just too late to stop the victims of the Snap from being resurrected as thousands of heroes returned to stop him. Despite all of Thanos' best efforts, he was unable to claim victory as Tony Stark used the Infinity Stones to destroy the Chitauri, Outriders and Thanos himself, finally ending his reign.</p>
